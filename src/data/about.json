  "body": "I'm a perpetual learner and love all things related to web development; however, this wasn't always the case. I graduated from UC San Diego with majors in Economics and Neuroscience and shortly after graduation began working as an analyst at a biotech focused hedge fund. While I was incredibly thankful for this rare and unique opportunity, I wasn't passionate about my job. This led me to search for a career I would love and I'm proud to say it led me to full-stack web development.",
