  "body": "I'm a perpetual learner and love all things related to software engineering â€“ but this wasn't always the case. I graduated from UC San Diego with dual majors in Economics and Neuroscience, and shortly thereafter began working as an analyst at a biotech-focused hedge fund. While I was incredibly thankful for this exceptional opportunity, I just wasn't passionate about my job. This led me to search for a career where I could express myself and help others.",
